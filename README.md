Tired of going slow and dont want to turn derails off all the time

Well this mod lets you set a max speed to not dreail at only after you go past that set speed will you derail 

Example u set it to 60 as long as you dont go past 60 you wont have a derail even if the track speed is 20

NOTE: when past the speed you set for example u set it to 20 and you go 40 and the track speed is 70 track speed will still apply b4 the drail u have to be past the set speed & track speed for a derail
